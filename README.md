# Setup Jest with coverage

How to setup Jest in a project and produce a coverage report.

### Setup

To run the project open up the terminal and follow these instruction:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/giopunt/setup-jest-with-coverage.git && cd setup-jest-with-coverage
```
Then install the dependencies

```sh
# npm
$ npm install
```

```sh
# or if you prefer yarn
$ yarn 
```


### Run the tests

Then to run the tests use:

```sh
# npm
$ npm run test

You will now find a report in the output of your terminal or under `coverage/lcov-report/index.html`.
